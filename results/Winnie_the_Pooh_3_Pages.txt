CHAPTER I
IN WHICH We Are Introduced to
Winnie-the-Pooh and Some
Bees, and the Stories Begin
HERE is Edward Bear, coming
downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back
of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far
as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs,
but sometimes he feels that there really is another
way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment
and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there
isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready
to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
When I first heard his name, I said, just as you
are going to say, “But I thought he was a boy?"
“So did I," said Christopher Robin.
"Then you can't call him Winnie?"
"I don't."
"But you said-

"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what
'ther' means?"

“Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope
you do too, because it is all the explanation you are
going to get.
Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some
sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he
likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a
story. This evening-
"What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.
"What about a story?” I said.
"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh
one?"
"I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories
does he like?”
"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.'
"Oh, I see.”
"So could you very sweetly?"
"I'll try," I said.
So I tried,

Once upon a time, a very long time ago now,
about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest
all by himself under the name of Sande: s.
("What does 'under the name' mean?" asked
Christopher Robin.
“It means he had the name over the door in gold
letters, and lived under it."

"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Chris-
topher Robin.
"Now I am," said a growly voice.
"Then I will go on," said I.)
One day when he was out walking, he came to
an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the
middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from
the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.
Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree,
put his head between his paws and began to think.
