      "didn't hold with such nonsense.\n",
      "Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\n",
      "drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\n",
      "very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\n",
      "usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\n",
      "time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\n",
      "small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n",
      "The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\n",

      "Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\n",
      "seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\n",

      "When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\n",
      "starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\n",
      "mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley\n",
      "hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley\n",
      "gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\n",
      "None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n",
      "At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\n",

      "sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\n",
      "light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley\n",
      "drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\n",
      "now reading the sign that said Privet Drive no, looking at the sign; cats\n",
      "couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\n",
      "cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\n",

      "-\n",
      "But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\n",

      "a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\n",

      "the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\n",
      "statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn't so\n",
      "much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\n",
      "swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\n",
      "A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\n",
      "suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.\n",
      "The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\n",
      "Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\n",
      "thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\n",
      "long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\n",
      "swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\n",
      "bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\n",
      "and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man's name was\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore.\n",
      "Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\n",
      "street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\n",
      "busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\n",
      "he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\n",
      "staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\n",
      "cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.\"\n",
      "He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\n",
      "silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\n",
      "-\n",
      "nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again the next\n",
      "lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\n",
      "only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\n",
      "were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\n",
      "now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that\n",
      "was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\n",
      "inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\n",
      "down on the wall next to the cat. He didn't look at it, but after a moment he\n",
      "spoke to it.\n",
      "\"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\"\n",
      "He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\n",
      "a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\n",
      "shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\n",
      "cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\n",
      "distinctly ruffled.\n",
      "\"How did you know it was me?” she asked.\n",
      "\"My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\"\n",
      "\"You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said\n",
      "Professor McGonagall.\n",
      "\"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\n",
      "dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\"\n",
      "Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\n",
      "\"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You'd think\n",
      "they'd be a bit more careful, but no even the Muggles have noticed\n",

      "something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\n",

      "\"You can't blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. \"We've had precious\n",
      "little to celebrate for eleven years.\"\n",
      "\"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that's no reason\n",
      "to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\n",
      "broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\n",

      "Dumbledore?\"\n",
      "\"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful\n",
      "for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\"\n",
      "\"A what?\"\n",
      "\"A lemon drop. They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.\"\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't\n",
      "think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-know-Who\n",
      "has gone\n",

      "\"Only because you're too — well — noble to use them.\"\n",

      "\"It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\n",
      "told me she liked my new earmuffs.”\n",

      "It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\n",

      "look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned.\n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\n",
